# Asterism 🌌

**Asterism** is a vibe-coded, minimalist, interactive web app that visualizes the interconnections between books, capturing the exact passages that bridge them.

## About

This app is primarily a log of my own reading journey, with the data still maintained manually by me. In retrospect, it may as well serve as an alternative to modern recommendation algorithms, inviting one to discover books by tracing the paper trails authors leave behind.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization:** A physics-based network graph where books are stars and citations are the gravity that binds them.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Click any connection to reveal the specific **quote** linking two books.
- **Deep Search:** View the entire universe of books, or isolate a specific book and seeing only its 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-degree connections.
- **Focus & Camera:** Automatic camera panning and zooming to focus on selected nodes or clusters.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 19
- **Visualization:** D3.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Icons:** Lucide React
